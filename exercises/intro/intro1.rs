// About this `I AM NOT DONE` thing:
// We sometimes encourage you to keep trying things on a given exercise, even
// after you already figured it out. If you got everything working and feel
// ready for the next exercise, remove the `I AM NOT DONE` comment below.
// Execute `rustlings hint intro1` or use the `hint` watch subcommand for a hint.
//
// If you're running this using `rustlings watch`: The exercise file will be reloaded
// when you change one of the lines below! Try adding a `println!` line, or try changing
// what it outputs in your terminal. Try removing a semicolon and see what happens!

fn main() {
    println!("Hello");
}
